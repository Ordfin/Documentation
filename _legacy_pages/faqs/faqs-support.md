## What if I need help? Do you have customer support?

We love being in touch with users and are happy to help with anything you may need. Our priority is to help users progress fast and push the boundaries of what is possible to achieve with Superalgos.

## May I ask for features I may be missing?

Yes. We keep a wish list for new features in the form of <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/issues" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issues in the Superalgos repository</a>. If you are missing a key feature, feel free to open an issue starting the subject with the word ```Improvement:```. Please be thorough on your explanation about what you wish and how you envision the feature should work, and make sure you follow the thread so that you may answer questions the developers may have.

We make no promises as of what features may be developed when, but we do our best to keep up with the Community's requests.
