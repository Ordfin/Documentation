<strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. ALTHOUGH STRATEGIES SHIPPING WITH SUPERALGOS MAY BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL, SUPERALGOS DOES NOT MAKE ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RECOMMENDATION AS OF HOW YOU SHOULD USE THEM. WE SHARE STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

<br/><br/><strong>Performance in backtesting is not an indication of live trading performance.</strong> Live performance may vary in relation to performance in backtesting, for better or for worse, most likely for worse. This happens because the design of trading strategies is done after the fact, with the hindsight of what happened in a certain range of the market. Patterns upon which strategies may be based on may keep occurring or not. Strategies attempt to interpret patterns and predict what may follow, but they are far from being perfect or accurate. The best-case scenario is a strategy being right more times than it is wrong.

<br/><br/><strong>Live performance is not an indication of future performance.</strong> Similarly, even when a strategy has delivered a certain performance trading live, there is no guarantee of what performance the strategy may achieve in the future. Live performance results are certainly more valuable than backtesting or simulated performance but still can't predict the future.

<br/><br/><strong>Strategies lose effectiveness with time.</strong> How much time? No-one knows. Markets evolve, change, go through different cycles, both long and short-term, some of which may not have been tested. That is true for all markets, let alone crypto, which is a very young market, still in its very early stages. Crypto markets change dramatically fast, as the market cap increases, more pro-traders enter the space, more smart money pours larger capitals, more bots take over operations of ever-increasing volumes, more complexity is added to the ecosystem with the availability of derivative markets, and so on.
