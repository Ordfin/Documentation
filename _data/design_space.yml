design_space: "The design space is the visual environment that hosts all system and user definitions. In practical terms, it is the black space below the slider that splits the screen horizontally, separating the design space in the bottom from the charting space on top. As a hierarchy, it features nodes that enable user-control over certain aspects of the look, feel, and behavior of the space."

space_style: "The space style node features controls over the look and feel of the space, in particular, of background colors and font sizes."

space_settings: "The space settings node features controls over the phisics, proportions, and positioning of icons representing node, and their menus."
