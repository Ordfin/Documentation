## We Need Your Help Now With an Issue We Can't Solve!

{% include callout.html type="success" content="When you search for <code>crypto trading bot</code> in Github.com, Superalgos is on the 4th page of the search results because the repo has too few stars and forks. For the project to advance faster, we need more developers to be able to find us! There are hundreds of people in our Community group. Let's put those stars and forks in the hundreds too! Superalgos deserves to be on the first page of the results, and it only takes a minute to put a star on and fork the repo... <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>click this link and do it now!</a>" %}

## Want to Help Superalgos Grow?

**We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to Superalgos!**

Superalgos is a collective project, still at an early stage. Your help is valued and you have the opportunity to play a role in the success of the project! 

{% include callout.html type="success" content="Contributing in the early stages is a great way to leave a mark and build your reputation within the incipient community. It will earn you a spot in the <a href='https://superalgos.org/about-contributors.shtml' target='_blank'>Top Contributors</a> page on the website and will make you eligible for incentives that may be put in place in the future." %}

The project thrives thanks to contributions, as there's only so much founders and project maintainers may achieve on their own. It is always positive that the community knows who contributed what, and proper attribution is a fundamental part of the culture we wish to build for Superalgos: the realization that we are all better off collaborating.

{% include tip.html content="We value all contributions and you do not need to make any hard commitments! Collaboration is about adding up, so we are happy with whatever time and effort you may be able to give!" %}

{% include important.html content="All contributions are subject to the terms of the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/blob/master/LICENSE' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Apache License 2.0</a>. " %}

## All Users

### Spread the Word

Like with every open-source project, the more people uses the software and the more people gets to collaborate, the better the software gets over time. Spreading the word is a possitive sum game that benefits everyone.

## Advanced Users

### Test the Unreleased Version

Superalgos is always in development. We've been delivering a new version of the system every other month on average. If you are proficient in using the stable version, you may be of great help in testing the new version and reporting any bugs you may find.

<a href='contributing-testing.html'>Start testing!</a>

## Designers

### Design Icons

The Design Space features hierarchies that represent data structures in which each node is visually represented by an icon. Contributing to the design of new icons and improving existing ones is a great way to help the project speed up the delivery of new features and make the system more attractive and easy to understand.

## Writers

### Improve the Documentation

The documentation is a crucial aspect of the project and is the bottleneck with every upcoming release. Contributing new documentation would help us deliver each release faster. Improving the existing documentation would help lower entry barriers for new users, and make the system accessible to more people.

### Make a Tutorial

The new tutorials feature allows anyone to build interactive tutorials, just like the one welcoming new users, giving them a tour of the system the first time they run the app. If by using Superalgos you've mastered any big or small tasks for which there are no tutorials yet, it'd be awesome if you created one to help smooth the learning curve for users coming after you!

### Write an Article

Everyone using Superalgos benefits from a larger user base: the more users test and push the boundaries of a complex system, the faster we may get to a stable and polished version, and finally break out of the beta phase. Writing an article for Hacker Noon, a Medium publication, or the specialized media about how Superalgos helps you with your trading is likely the most powerful way to spread the word.

## Developers

### Build a Data Mine

Data mines and the indicators within are crucial elements of trading intelligence. Contributing a few indicators is currently the best way developers may help to realize the project's vision of a Collective Trading Intelligence. At the same time, it's the best way to dive under the hood and learn how the system works so that you may one day contribute to the code base.

### Remove Bugs

The lead developer is usually focused on developing for the next release. Helping with removing simple bugs in the existing code base is a great way to help the community have a better experience using the system. Join us in the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdevelop' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Superalgos Develop</a> Telegram group and start submitting your PRs!

### Dive Into the Codebase

Once you've gained enough experience building data mines and removing bugs, you may be ready to dive deep into the codebase. It's a large system, so take a deep breath!
