{% include callout.html type="success" content="Beta 7 is already in the ```master``` branch and new developments are already under way. The instructions below are only relevant once there is something specific to test. Stay tuned in the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdevelop' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Superalgos Develop Telegram Group</a> for news about what is cooking for Beta 8." %}

{% include important.html content="The main challenge with testing the unreleased version is that it is not documented. Therefore, you need a good understanding of how Superalgos works from having used the current and/or previous versions, so that you may follow the few explanations available and figure out the new functionality as you go." %}

## Download and Install the Software in the ```develop``` Branch

Superalgos Beta 8 is available in the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/tree/develop' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>```develop``` branch of the Superalgos repository</a>.

## Workspace

When you run Beta 8 for the first time, the default workspace is loaded. This workspace may be updated at any point, as it is kept up-to-date with changes in the system.

## Join Developers and Testers in the Develop Group

Users testing Beta 8 meet in the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdevelop' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Superalgos Develop Telegram Group</a>. All questions and issues concerning Beta 8 must be channeled through this group.

## Notes on Beta 8

There's no news at this point in time. Stay tuned!

## Documentation (WIP)

The work-in-progress is usually documented at the <a href='https://julian-molina.github.io/Documentation/' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>develop documentation site</a>. However, the site is down until it becomes relevant again.

{% include tip.html content="Keep in mind that some information in the develop documentation may not reflect how the system works in the develop version. It's important to read the lead developer's notes in the Develop group to become aware of what are the main system areas that have changed." %}
